                                At St. Mary's Catholic School, religious education is not just a subjectâ€”it's the foundation of our
                                educational mission. We integrate Catholic teachings and values throughout our curriculum and school
                                life, helping students develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and a deep understanding of
                                their faith.

                                Our religious education program is designed to nurture the spiritual growth of each student, providing
                                them with the knowledge, skills, and experiences they need to live as disciples of Christ in today's
                                world. Through prayer, worship, religious instruction, and service to others, students learn to
                                integrate faith into every aspect of their lives.
