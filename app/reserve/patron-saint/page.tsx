                                Our school is honored to be under the patronage of St. Mary, the Mother of God. As the mother of Jesus
                                Christ, Mary holds a special place in the Catholic faith and serves as a model of faith, humility, and
                                devotion for our entire school community.
                            </p>

                                Mary's unwavering "yes" to God's plan, her steadfast presence throughout Jesus' life, and her role as
                                the first disciple inspire us to live our own faith with similar courage and commitment. Her example
                                guides our educational mission and shapes our school culture.

                                    Mary was born to Joachim and Anne, who had been childless for many years before her birth. According
                                    to tradition, her parents had promised to dedicate her to God's service, and Mary was presented at the
                                    Temple at a young age.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The pivotal moment in Mary's life came when the Angel Gabriel appeared to her, announcing that she had
                                    been chosen to be the mother of the Messiah. Despite her initial confusion, Mary responded with
                                    complete trust: "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word"
                                    (Luke 1:38).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Throughout Jesus' life, Mary was present at key momentsâ€”from the wedding at Cana, where she prompted
                                    Jesus' first public miracle, to the foot of the cross, where Jesus entrusted her to the care of the
                                    apostle John. After Jesus' ascension, Mary was present with the apostles at Pentecost, witnessing the
                                    birth of the Church.

                                    St. Mary's Catholic School was founded in 1925 by the Sisters of Mercy, who dedicated the school to
                                    the Blessed Virgin Mary. The sisters chose Mary as the school's patron because of her perfect example
                                    of discipleship and her special role in the Church.
                                </p>

                                    Throughout our school's history, we have maintained a strong devotion to Mary and have sought to
                                    instill in our students a deep appreciation for her role in salvation history. The beautiful statue of
                                    Mary in our main entrance and the Marian garden on our campus serve as daily reminders of our patron
                                    saint's presence in our school community.

                                    with special activities and prayer services throughout the week when we return from Christmas break.
                                    This celebration helps strengthen our community's connection to our patron saint and our Catholic
