With all the national and local tensions, the schools had been at the standstill for nearly two years. When Fr. Urios arrived in Surigao on his way to Butuan in February, 1901, he, Fr.

The manifest witnessed the indignation of Catholic parents to the education of their children. It was addressed to Governor Garcia of Surigao, ‚ÄòWe, the Catholics of Cabadbaran, inform you that since the establishment of the Catholic school here, we are being deprived of our total freedom which the law of the United States grants us in matters of religion, as the Colonel of the Filipino milicia stationed here had told us."

If they dared to open the school while still a ‚Äòvisita‚Äô of Butuan parish, they would not stop supporting it in face of overwhelming odds. They would even more be unstoppable once a resident priest was assigned and they were given the privilege of being a full-pledge parish in 1913. It is needless to go into details how things transpired from thereon. It is enough that we would have a look at what the new priests (Dutch Missionaries of the Sacred Heart) would do one they took over in 1935 from the Spanish Jesuits."

It has the lowest tuition fee among the schools, allowing students to enroll at very low costs. Enrollment has always been slow due to the presence of established universities and colleges in the city and neighboring cities and towns. Most of our students come from the city's barangays and neighboring towns and are graduates of public schools. Some of them are working students who rely solely on government financial assistance."

            "The founding of Cabadbaran Parochial School, later known as Candelaria Institute, is rooted in the missionary zeal and educational vision of Spanish Jesuit missionaries and Dutch Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC). These pioneers overcame political, religious, and logistical challenges to bring faith-based education to Cabadbaran.",
            "Fr. Matias Roure, S.J., a Spanish Jesuit, reopened the Catholic school in 1903 amid post-war tensions. Fr. Saturnino Urios, S.J., supervised the Agusan mission from Butuan and lent vital support to educational efforts in the region. In 1913, Fr. Jose Espa√±a, S.J. became the first parish priest of Cabadbaran, stabilizing the parish and supporting the school‚Äôs growth.",
            "In 1935, the Dutch MSC missionaries, led by Rev. Cornelius van de Loo, MSC, formally incorporated the school as Cabadbaran Parochial School. He was joined by founding trustees Rev. Martin Fransen, MSC, Rev. Rudolf van Es, MSC, Rev. John Ruijter, MSC, and Rev. Vicente Celeste, MSC in 1938. Together, they established and expanded the elementary and kindergarten departments.",
            "These founders were more than administrators‚Äîthey were educators, spiritual leaders, and community builders. Their legacy continues to shape the mission and identity of Candelaria Institute through their unwavering commitment to Catholic education."
