For the education of the girls, the Jesuits had brought in a community of ‘Beaterio’ Sister (now RVM) to Butuan, but they returned to Manila after the imprisonment of the missionaries. With all the national and local tensions, the schools had been at the standstill for nearly two years. When Fr. Urios arrived in Surigao on his way to Butuan in February, 1901, he, Fr. Parache and Fr. Heras had a conference in Surigao to assess the situation in the district and inform the Manila superior of their opinion"

It is true that by the law, parents were granted the freedom to enroll their children in schools of their own choice.",
                "While we know that Fr. Matias Roure re-opened the catholic school in 1903, an undated manifest signed “Los Catolicos de Cabadbaran” can be found in the Sant Cugat Archives. The manifest witnessed the indignation of Catholic parents to the education of their children. It was addressed to Governor Garcia of Surigao, ‘We, the Catholics of Cabadbaran, inform you that since the establishment of the Catholic school here, we are being deprived of our total freedom which the law of the United States grants us in matters of religion, as the Colonel of the Filipino milicia stationed here had told us."

And here in Cabadbaran, it is clear that while a resident priest was assigned here only in 1913, before that there was a school, a convent and a church. This earned Cabadbaran the title ‘este famoso pueblo!’. If they dared to open the school while still a ‘visita’ of Butuan parish, they would not stop supporting it in face of overwhelming odds. They would even more be unstoppable once a resident priest was assigned and they were given the privilege of being a full-pledge parish in 1913. It is needless to go into details how things transpired from thereon. It is enough that we would have a look at what the new priests (Dutch Missionaries of the Sacred Heart) would do one they took over in 1935 from the Spanish Jesuits."
